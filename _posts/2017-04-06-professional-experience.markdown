With over a decade of hands-on experience, Konstantina has served as an ESL/EFL teacher across diverse educational settings, from state kindergartens and private primary schools to adult education centers and one-on-one tutoring. She has consistently demonstrated the ability to design inclusive and engaging curricula tailored to mixed-ability learners, particularly in early childhood education. Her teaching journey includes roles in reputable institutions such as I.M. Panagiotopoulos School and Pedagogiki – BIRDS Private School, where she also took initiative in extracurricular projects such as student theatre productions and museum visits. In parallel, she has collaborated extensively with language assessment bodies, serving as an oral examiner, interlocutor, and proctor for organizations such as the Hellenic American Union, ESB, Esolnet Hellas, and Pearson.


<!--You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
