With a strong foundation in English language education and applied linguistics, I am eager to participate in the Crossing: Learning Bridges Across the Atlantic program to foster deeper intercultural collaboration and pedagogical exchange. My professional journey as an ESL/EFL teacher across diverse Greek educational contexts—ranging from kindergartens to adult learners—has been shaped by a continuous engagement with inclusive practices and digital innovation. I am particularly drawn to the program’s mission of building educational bridges, as my own research explores the intersection of AI-supported learning and multilingual competence, areas that transcend national boundaries. My previous collaborations with U.S.-based institutions, such as the Hellenic American Union, and my ongoing graduate studies in educational technology position me to contribute meaningfully to transatlantic dialogue. I envision this program as a unique opportunity to exchange best practices, co-develop inclusive language teaching frameworks, and enrich my understanding of how educational values are shared and transformed across cultures.
