  <h2>AI hallucinations</h2>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The present article comprises a literature review of the AI-generated hallucinations in educational contexts along with examples of previous research, where AI tools may produce false, misleading or fabricated information. The risks of such errors are explored, their implications for students and educators are demonstrated and finally strategies and pedagogical implications are suggested in order for this phenomenon to be alleviated and eventually annihilated. A key target of this paper is on developing constructive questioning techniques which will promote critical engagement with AI outputs.</p>

  <h2>Fostering Multilingual Proficiency<br>Trilingualism in Greek Primary Schools</h2>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This conceptual paper investigates the implementation of trilingual education in Greek primary schools, with a particular focus on students who have learning disabilities. This article examines how trilingual curriculaâ€”encompassing Greek, English, and an additional foreign languageâ€”can be designed to support diverse learning needs. Results indicate that well-structured trilingual programs, bolstered by differentiated instructional strategies and assistive technologies, can enhance language acquisition and academic self-esteem among learners with learning disabilities. Additionally, collaborative planning between mainstream and special education teachers emerged as a vital component in addressing individual student challenges. These issues highlight the need for sustained teacher training, resource allocation, and inclusive policy frameworks that promote equal access to language learning opportunities. Ultimately, this paper underscores the transformative potential of trilingual education in fostering both linguistic proficiency and social inclusion for all students in Greek primary schools.</p>
