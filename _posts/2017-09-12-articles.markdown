## AI hallucinations

**Abstract:** The present article comprises a literature review of the AI-generated hallucinations in 
educational contexts along with examples of previous research, where AI tools may 
produce false, misleading or fabricated information. The risks of such errors are 
explored, their implications for students and educators are demonstrated and finally 
strategies and pedagogical implications are suggested in order for this phenomenon to 
be alleviated and eventually annihilated. A key target of this paper is on developing 
constructive questioning techniques which will promote critical engagement with AI 
outputs.

## Fostering Multilingual Proficiency Trilingualism in Greek Primary Schools. The case of children with learning disabilities


**Abstract:** This conceptual paper investigates the implementation of trilingual education in 
Greek primary schools, with a particular focus on students who have learning 
disabilities. This article examines how trilingual curricula—encompassing Greek, 
English, and an additional foreign language—can be designed to support diverse 
learning needs. Results indicate that well-structured trilingual programs, bolstered by 
differentiated instructional strategies and assistive technologies, can enhance language 
acquisition and academic self-esteem among learners with learning disabilities. 
Additionally, collaborative planning between mainstream and special education 
teachers emerged as a vital component in addressing individual student challenges. 
These issues highlight the need for sustained teacher training, resource allocation, and 
inclusive policy frameworks that promote equal access to language learning 
opportunities. Ultimately, this paper underscores the transformative potential of 
trilingual education in fostering both linguistic proficiency and social inclusion for all 
students in Greek primary schools.
