  <p>
    Konstantina Alevizou is an experienced ESL/EFL educator and emerging researcher whose work bridges language education, inclusive pedagogy, and the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in education practices. With over a decade of teaching experience across state schools, private institutions, and adult education centers in Greece, she has developed a pedagogical approach rooted in empathy, cultural awareness, and differentiated instruction. Her practice is underpinned by her academic training, holding a BA in English Language and Literature from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and an MA in Applied Linguistics from Hellenic American University, where she graduated with honors.
