  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    As I have long been interested in educational research, I am exhilarated to be included in your scientific journal.
    As my resume indicates, I have fifteen years of professional experience as an instructor of the English language to a 
    department with multiple individuals. I am sure you are aware of the flexibility, focus, and diplomacy such positions require. 
    I want to bring the knowledge and insight gained through these various experiences through my academic research and professional 
    experience. 
  </p>
   
  <p>I have much to offer in the way of diversity of experience in that I have gained in my life so far. In my current job,
    I have had the opportunity to sharpen my organizational skills, problem solving, attention to detail, my ability to work with 
    speed and accuracy as well as cooperate productively with others. Throughout my studies, I have gained experience in research, 
    writing reports, and designing high impact PowerPoint presentations, to facilitate my performance and achieve my academic goals.
  </p> 

  <p>
    Combined with this experience, my strengths, such as patience, empathy and work ethic, make me a well-rounded and reliable 
    researcher. In all the previous experiences that I had, both academic and professional, I have held, I have taken every 
    opportunity for career advancement and growth. I am bringing the same commitment, creativity and added value to the vision 
    and goals of your organization which I admire for its culture and dynamic presence in the industry. I would welcome the 
    opportunity to discuss any questions you may have relating to our submission and future insights. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a final comment I would like to add that I would be grateful if I was given the opportunity to explore more insight in my 
    career and that is why I would like to thank you once again for the opportunity. I would like to add that I have graduated from 
    the Hellenic American University seven years ago. Recently I have decided to further my studies by acquiring a second Masters 
    degree in Learning Technologies and STEAM education by the European University of Cyprus. My ultimate goal is to become a PhD 
    candidate.
